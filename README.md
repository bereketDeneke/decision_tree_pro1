Instruction:
> Run emulator emulator @Pixel_2_API_30
> For now, you don't need to run the app using react-native framework. Wherefore, to run the app follow the instruction down below:
> Open the <code>PWA</code> folder.
> Then open index.html on chrome browser
> And to emulate different screen sizes follow the following steps:
> Step 1 – Start Chrome
> Step 2 – Go to navigation and open Developer tools (Menu > Tools > Developer Tools or press F12)
> Step 3 – Click on setting icon on top-right side
> Step 4 – Open Overrides section to enable Show ‘Emulation‘ view in console

Old Progress Report:
> User Interaction Modal: The user interaction modal has been updated to enhance user experience.

> Direct Connection Establishment: A direct connection has been established between the menu items and the decision tree to improve navigation.

> Fab Button Design Upgrade: The Fab button design has undergone an upgrade to include the features of attaching a file and searching by keyword, providing a more efficient user experience.

> Implement file attachment functionality

> Implement real-time updating of node information upon user submission through modal dialog


Current Progress Report:
> Changed the theme to match the color scheme of the decision tree for aesthetic consistency.

> Implemented a feature to highlight the most recent node, allowing users to easily track their latest decision.

> Implemented smooth scrolling functionality for a better user experience.

> Added responsive swipe gesture to replace traditional scrolling, providing a more modern and intuitive interaction method.

> Addressed issues with unwanted canvas interactions, such as the appearance of a blue rectangle on drag that resulted in a flickering and unstable GUI. Additionally, added a feature to prevent users from creating new links to connect nodes explicitly. 

> Removed any other unfitting features of the MindFusion framework that were not relevant to the project.


What's next:
> Implement keyword-based search functionality

> API integration
